# Encounter with GitHub <a href="javascript:void(0);"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/SiD-on%20GitHub-green.svg" alt="SiD on GitHub"  title="SiD on GitHub" ></a>

<p>This is my first interaction with world's most powerful version control system as well as great collabrative platform called <strong>GitHub</strong></p>

<p>I have learned few basic stuff about <strong>GitHub</strong>. Understood the workflow and things about  <strong>"Repos"</strong></p>

<h3>Yes! I am late to the party. But well at least I made it.... </h3>
