# Encounter with GitHub

<p>This is my first interaction with world's most powerful version control system as well as great collabrative platform called <strong>GitHub</strong></p>

<p>I have learned few basic stuff about <strong>GitHub</strong>. Understood the workflow and things about  <strong>"Repos"</strong></p>

<h3>Yes! I am late to the party. But well at least i made it....</h3>

<p>Game <strong>On</strong></p>
